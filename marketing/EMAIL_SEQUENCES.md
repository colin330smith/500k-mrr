# MedSpa RevAI - Automated Email Sequences

## Sequence 1: ROI Calculator Lead Nurture

### Email 1: Immediate (0 min after signup)
**Subject:** Your MedSpa revenue report is ready

```
Hi,

Here's a quick summary of what you're losing each month:

• No-shows: $[X]
• Slow lead response: $[X]
• Lapsed clients: $[X]
• Total: $[X]/month

With MedSpa RevAI, you could recover approximately $[recovery_amount]/month.

That's a [X]x return on a $497/month investment.

Want to see how it works? Two options:

1. Call our AI demo right now: (833) 425-1223
   (No signup needed - just call and ask about Botox pricing)

2. Start your 14-day free trial: [SIGNUP_LINK]

Talk soon,
MedSpa RevAI

P.S. 62% of med spa inquiries come after hours. Is your phone answered at 9pm on a Saturday?
```

### Email 2: Day 1
**Subject:** The $8,000/month leak in your med spa

```
Quick question:

What happens when a patient no-shows at your practice?

Most med spas: Nothing. Empty chair. Lost revenue.

What should happen: AI texts them within 1 hour, offers to reschedule, and 70% rebook within 48 hours.

That's the difference between losing $8,000/month and recovering it.

Here's a real conversation our AI had yesterday:

---
AI: "Hi Sarah, this is the AI assistant for Glow Med Spa. I noticed you couldn't make your 2pm appointment today - no worries! Would you like to reschedule? I have tomorrow at 3pm or Thursday at 11am open."

Patient: "Oh sorry I totally forgot! Thursday works"

AI: "Perfect! You're confirmed for Thursday at 11am. We'll send a reminder the day before. See you then!"
---

70% recovery rate. Automatic.

```

### Email 3: Day 3
**Subject:** Why 79% of your leads book elsewhere

```
Here's a stat that should make you uncomfortable:

79% of leads go to whoever responds first.

Not whoever has the best reviews.
Not whoever has the best pricing.
The first responder wins.

If your lead response time is over 5 minutes, you're losing 79% of potential patients to competitors.

MedSpa RevAI responds to every inquiry in under 5 minutes. 24/7. Even at 11pm on a Sunday.

Your AI could be booking consultations right now while you read this email.

(14-day free trial, no credit card required)
```

### Email 4: Day 5
**Subject:** "I didn't know my phone was even ringing"

```
True story from last week:

A med spa owner started her free trial on Monday. By Friday, she'd gotten 23 calls answered by our AI.

Her reaction: "I had no idea we were getting this many calls. Most of these were going to voicemail."

Of those 23 calls:
- 8 were pricing inquiries → 5 booked consultations
- 6 were existing patients → 4 rescheduled
- 9 were general questions → handled instantly

That's 9 appointments she would have lost.

At her average treatment value of $400, that's $3,600 in one week.

The AI paid for itself 7x over in 5 days.

What's your phone doing right now?

### Email 5: Day 7
**Subject:** Last chance: 14-day free trial

```
This is my last email about the free trial.

Here's what happens in the next 14 days:

Option A: You do nothing
- Your phone keeps going to voicemail
- No-shows keep no-showing
- Leads keep booking with competitors who respond faster
- You lose another $8,000+ in preventable revenue

Option B: You try MedSpa RevAI (free)
- Every call answered in under 1 second
- No-shows get texted, 70% rebook
- Leads get responses in 5 minutes
- You see exactly what you've been missing

There's no risk. No credit card. Cancel anytime.

If it doesn't work for you, delete it. No hard feelings.

But if it does work, you'll wonder how you ever ran your spa without it.

```
Hey,

Quick question: Have you had any no-shows in the last 3 days?
