**Title:** Built an AI that recovers no-shows automatically - looking for beta testers

```
Hey med spa owners,

I built an AI receptionist that texts patients within an hour of a missed appointment. Getting about 70% of them to rebook.

It also answers calls 24/7 and responds to leads in under 5 minutes (I was terrible at this and losing patients to faster competitors).

Looking for 5 med spas to try it free for 30 days. I'll help you set it up.

If you want to hear how it sounds first, you can call the demo line: (833) 425-1223 - ask it about Botox pricing or say you missed an appointment.

Anyone interested? DM me or comment below.

### r/estheticians (48K members)
**Title:** What do you do when clients no-show?

```
I keep seeing posts about no-shows costing practices money. What's your current process when someone doesn't show up?

Do you call them? Text? Just wait for them to rebook?

I've been working on something to help with this but curious what the standard practice is right now.

**Title:** Service business owners: How do you handle after-hours inquiries?

```
Running a service business (appointments-based). Getting a lot of inquiries after we close - website forms, missed calls, etc.

By the time we respond in the morning, a lot of them have already booked with competitors.

What are you all doing about this? Hiring night staff? Using some kind of answering service?

I've been testing an AI solution but curious what others do.

Quick question for the group:

How many no-shows did you have last week?

I was losing $6-8K/month to missed appointments until I automated the follow-up. Now getting about 70% of them rescheduled within 48 hours.

Happy to share what I did if anyone's interested. It's not complicated but it made a huge difference for my numbers.
```

**Follow-up when people ask:**
```
Sure! I set up an AI that texts patients within an hour of missing their appointment. Something like "Hey [name], no worries about missing your appointment today! Want me to reschedule you for tomorrow at 3pm or Thursday at 11am?"

Most people respond because it's immediate and low-pressure.

If you want to hear how it sounds, I have a demo line you can call: (833) 425-1223

It also handles incoming calls 24/7 which has been great for after-hours leads.

### Personal Post
```
Med spa owners: you're probably losing $8K/month and don't realize it.

Here's the math:
• 20% no-show rate (industry average)
• 80 appointments/week
• $350 average treatment

= 64 missed appointments/month
= $22,400 in lost potential revenue

Even if only 35% would have been recoverable, that's ~$8K.

The solution isn't calling them hours later when you notice.

It's texting them within 60 minutes with an easy rebook option.

I built an AI that does exactly this. 70% rebook within 48 hours.

If you want to hear how it sounds, call (833) 425-1223 and ask about Botox pricing or say you missed your appointment.

Search for questions about:
- "How do medical spas reduce no-shows?"
- "Best scheduling software for med spa"
- "How to handle missed appointments"

**Template Answer:**
```
I run a med spa and this used to be a huge problem for us too.

The game-changer was automating the follow-up. When someone misses an appointment, they get a text within an hour offering to reschedule. No guilt-tripping, just "no worries, when works better for you?"

We went from losing $8K/month to recovering about 70% of those missed appointments.

The key is speed. Calling them the next day doesn't work - they've already moved on or booked elsewhere. But catching them right after they realize they forgot? Much higher success rate.

Happy to share more details if anyone's curious about the setup.

🧵 How med spas are losing $100K/year (and don't know it)

A breakdown of the 3 biggest revenue leaks I see:

1/ NO-SHOWS

20% is the industry average. On 80 appointments/week at $350 avg, that's $22,400/month in empty chairs.

Solution: Text within 1 hour of missed appointment. "No worries! Want to reschedule?"

70% rebook rate when you're fast.

2/ SLOW LEAD RESPONSE

79% of leads go to whoever responds first.

If you take 30+ minutes to reply to a "what's your Botox pricing?" inquiry, they've already called 3 competitors.

Solution: Respond in under 5 minutes. Every time. Even at 11pm on a Saturday.

3/ LAPSED CLIENTS

The patient who got Botox 5 months ago and forgot to rebook?

They're not gone - they just need a reminder.

"Hey Sarah, it's been a while! Ready for a touch-up? Here's 10% off this month."

---

Most med spas fix these with $3,500/month in additional staff.

We built an AI that does all three for $497/month.

Demo line (no signup): (833) 425-1223

Ask it about pricing. Tell it you missed an appointment. See how it handles it.

Hey [Name],

Quick question - what's your no-show rate like at [Spa Name]?

I built something that's helping med spas recover 70% of missed appointments automatically. Takes about 10 min to set up.

Not trying to sell you anything - just looking for feedback from actual spa owners.

Awesome!
