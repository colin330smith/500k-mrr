### Problem Awareness Tweets

**Tweet 1:**
```
Dental practices miss 32% of incoming calls.

That's 1 in 3 potential patients calling your competitor instead.

The crazy part? Most practice owners have no idea it's happening.
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The math on missed dental calls is brutal:

• 32% miss rate (industry avg)
• 85% won't leave voicemail
• $850+ lifetime patient value

Miss 10 calls/week = $442,000 lost annually

This is why we built an AI receptionist.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Front desk staff aren't the problem.

They're busy:
- Checking in patients
- Processing payments
- Answering questions
- Managing schedules

The phone is #5 on the priority list.

That's why AI makes sense here.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
"We don't miss calls"

Said every dental practice before they tracked it.

The data across 50 practices:
- Peak miss times: 11am-1pm, 4-6pm
- Avg hold time before hangup: 47 seconds
- After-hours calls missed: 100%

Track yours. You'll be shocked.
```

### Social Proof Tweets

**Tweet 5:**
```
Results from a practice using DentalCall AI for 90 days:

Before:
- 67% call answer rate
- 12 new patients/month

After:
- 93% call answer rate
- 19 new patients/month
- $47K additional annual revenue

Same marketing spend. Just stopped losing leads.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
"The AI sounds so natural that patients don't even realize they're not talking to a human."

- Dr. Sarah M., Austin TX

This is the moment voice AI became viable for business.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
We sent 197 cold emails yesterday.

Got 3 demo requests in 24 hours.

1.5% response rate on completely cold outreach.

The offer: "Your practice is probably losing $100K/year to missed calls. Let us show you."

Specific > Generic.
```

### Building in Public Tweets

**Tweet 8:**
```
Building DentalCall AI in public.

Week 1 stats:
- 197 emails sent
- 3 demos booked
- 0 revenue
- 0 ad spend

The playbook:
1. Cold email (free)
2. Reddit (free)
3. LinkedIn DMs (free)
4. Cold calls (free)

$0 CAC or die trying.
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
Lessons from building an AI product:

1. Pick a niche (dental > "all businesses")
2. Price with courage ($299, not $29)
3. Sell the ROI, not the tech
4. Free trial removes objections
5. Cold outreach still works

Day 3. Zero revenue. Full conviction.
```

**Tweet 10:**
```
Everyone's building AI wrappers.

We're building AI that:
- Answers real phone calls
- Has real conversations
- Books real appointments
- Makes real money for clients

The "AI sounds robotic" era is over.
```

### Direct Pitch Tweets

```

## DM Outreach Templates

### To Dental Practice Owners

**DM 1:**
```
Hey Dr. [Name] - noticed your practice in [City].

Quick question: do you know roughly how many patient calls your front desk misses each week?

No pitch - genuinely curious if this is a problem you experience.
```

**Follow-up if they respond:**
```
Appreciate the response!

Most practices we talk to miss 20-30% - usually during busy times or after hours.

We built an AI that handles this. Happy to show you a quick demo if you're curious - no pressure either way.
```

### To Dental Influencers/Consultants

**DM 2:**
```
Hey [Name] - love your content on dental practice growth.

We just launched an AI receptionist that helps practices recover missed call revenue. Getting solid early results (93% answer rate, $47K annual recovery).

Would love your thoughts if you have 5 min. Could be useful for your audience?
