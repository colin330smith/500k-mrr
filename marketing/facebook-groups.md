## Post Template 1: Question Hook

**Post:**
Quick question for practice owners...

How many calls do you think your front desk misses each week?

We just ran a study across 50 practices and the average was 32% of incoming calls going unanswered. That's basically 1 in 3 potential patients choosing someone else.

The main culprits:
- Staff busy with in-office patients
- Lunch breaks
- After-hours calls
- Hold times causing hangups

Anyone else tracking this? What solutions have worked for you?

(I have some data on what top practices are doing differently - happy to share if helpful)

## Post Template 2: Case Study

**Post:**
Case study: How one practice recovered $47K/year in lost revenue

A dentist I work with was spending $3K/month on marketing but couldn't figure out why growth was flat.

When we looked at the data:
- 80 calls/month from ads
- Only 55 were being answered
- 25 potential patients hitting voicemail

At $850 average patient value, that's $21K/month walking out the door.

The fix? We set up an AI system that answers every call 24/7. Sounds completely human, books appointments automatically.

90 days later:
- Answer rate: 67% → 93%
- New patients: 12 → 19/month
- Revenue recovered: ~$47K annually

The AI costs less than a part-time hire.

Anyone else dealing with missed call issues? Happy to share more details on what we did.

## Post Template 3: Value Bomb

**Post:**
🦷 FREE RESOURCE: Missed Call Calculator for Dental Practices

I built a simple calculator to help practices figure out how much revenue they're losing to missed calls.

Here's the formula:

**Monthly Missed Calls** × **$850** (avg patient LTV) = **Monthly Lost Revenue**

Example:
- 100 calls/month
- 32% miss rate (industry avg)
- 32 missed calls × $850 = $27,200/month lost

That's $326,400/year.

Most practices have no idea because they're not tracking it.

Quick wins to improve:
1. Track your miss rate (most phone systems have this)
2. Staff during peak miss times (11am-1pm, 4-6pm)
3. Set up overflow coverage
4. Consider AI answering (what we built)

Anyone want me to run the numbers for their practice? Drop your monthly call volume below.

## Post Template 4: Behind the Scenes

**Post:**
Building an AI receptionist for dental practices - lessons from the first week

Just launched DentalCall AI and wanted to share what's working:

**What it does:**
- Answers every call 24/7
- Books appointments in natural conversation
- Handles common patient questions
- Sends text confirmations

**Week 1 results:**
- 197 practices contacted
- 3 demo requests
- First trial starting tomorrow
- $0 revenue (but $0 ad spend too)

**What I've learned:**
1. Dentists are BUSY - email open rates are low, but responses are high-intent
2. The "AI sounds robotic" objection is dead - modern voice AI is incredible
3. ROI story resonates - "recover $47K in lost revenue" gets attention
4. Free trial removes all friction

**Next steps:**
- Follow up sequence
- Google Ads test
- More group engagement

Anyone else building for dental? Would love to connect.
