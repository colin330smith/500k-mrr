## First Comment (Maker Comment)
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Alex, founder of DentalCall AI.

**The Problem:**
Dental practices miss 32% of incoming calls. When staff are with patients, calls go to voicemail. 85% of those callers never call back - they just call the next dentist.

At $850+ lifetime value per patient, that's over $100K/year walking out the door for the average practice.

**The Solution:**
We built an AI that answers dental calls like a real receptionist:
- Picks up in <1 second, 24/7
- Sounds completely natural (patients can't tell)
- Books appointments conversationally
- Handles emergencies appropriately
- Sends text confirmations

**Why Now:**
Voice AI finally sounds human. GPT-4 level intelligence + ElevenLabs quality voice = indistinguishable from a real person.

**Early Results:**
- 93% call answer rate (vs 67% industry avg)
- 35% increase in booked appointments
- $47K+ annual revenue recovered per practice

**Pricing:**
- Starter: $299/mo (500 min)
- Professional: $599/mo (2,000 min) ⭐ Most popular
- Business: $999/mo (5,000 min)

All plans include a 7-day free trial.

Would love your feedback! Happy to answer any questions about voice AI, dental industry, or our tech stack.
