## AI Startup Launches Solution to Help Dental Practices Recover $100K+ in Annual Lost Revenue from Missed Calls

*DentalCall AI introduces 24/7 AI receptionist that answers patient calls, books appointments, and eliminates voicemail black holes*

**[City, State]** – DentalCall AI today announced the launch of its AI-powered phone answering system designed specifically for dental practices. The platform uses advanced voice AI to answer patient calls 24/7, conduct natural conversations, and book appointments automatically – addressing a $100K+ annual revenue leak that affects the average dental practice.

According to industry data, dental practices miss approximately 32% of incoming patient calls during business hours, with 85% of those callers never leaving a voicemail. Instead, they simply call the next dentist on their list. At an average lifetime patient value of $850+, this translates to over $100,000 in lost annual revenue for a typical practice.

"The problem isn't that dental practices don't care about their phones – it's that their staff are busy doing their jobs," said [Founder Name], Founder of DentalCall AI. "When a hygienist is mid-cleaning and three patients are waiting to check out, the phone becomes secondary. We built an AI that ensures no patient call ever goes unanswered, regardless of how busy the office is."

**Key Features of DentalCall AI:**
- Answers every call in under one second, 24/7/365
- Conducts natural, human-like conversations using advanced voice synthesis
- Books appointments directly into practice management systems
- Handles common patient questions about hours, insurance, and services
- Sends automated appointment confirmations via text
- Provides call transcripts and analytics dashboards
- Full HIPAA compliance with encrypted data storage

Early adopter practices report a 93% call answer rate (compared to the 67% industry average), 35% increases in booked appointments, and an average of $47,000 in recovered annual revenue.

"Most practice owners have no idea how many patients they're losing," added [Founder Name]. "When we show them the data, it's eye-opening. We had one practice discover they were missing 25+ calls per week – that's potentially $20,000 per month walking out the door."

DentalCall AI offers three pricing tiers starting at $299/month, with all plans including a 7-day free trial. The platform integrates with major practice management systems and can be set up in under 15 minutes.

**About DentalCall AI**
DentalCall AI is on a mission to ensure no dental practice ever loses a patient to a missed phone call. Using cutting-edge voice AI technology, the platform provides 24/7 phone coverage that sounds indistinguishable from a human receptionist. For more information, visit [website].
