## Connection Request Message (300 char limit)
```
Hi Dr. {{first_name}}! I work with dental practices to capture more appointments through AI-powered phone handling. Noticed {{practice_name}} - would love to connect and share what's working for practices in {{city}}. No pitch, just insights!
```

## Follow-up Message 1 (After connection)
```
Thanks for connecting, Dr. {{first_name}}!

Quick question - how many calls does your front desk miss each week?

Most practices we talk to estimate 20-30% - that's potentially $15K+/month in lost revenue.

We built DentalCall AI specifically to solve this. It answers every call 24/7, sounds completely natural, and books appointments directly into your system.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo this week? No pressure - just want to show you what's possible.

## Follow-up Message 2 (If no response after 5 days)

Hi Dr. {{first_name}},

Wanted to share a quick case study:

Dr. Chen's practice in Austin was missing 28% of calls. After implementing DentalCall AI:
- 93% call answer rate
- 35% more booked appointments
- $47K additional revenue from after-hours

We offer a free 7-day trial with full setup support.

Worth a quick call?

Hi Dr. {{first_name}},

Last note from me! Just wanted to share we're offering the first month free for practices that start this week.

If capturing more appointments and reducing front desk burden isn't a priority right now, no worries at all.

But if you're curious: https://local-lift.onrender.com

Best of luck with {{practice_name}}!
