# Cold Calling Script - Dental Practices

## Objective
Book a 15-minute demo call

## Call Flow

### Opening (10 seconds)
```
Hi, this is [Your Name] calling for [Dr. Last Name]. Is he/she available for a quick moment?
```

**If gatekeeper asks what it's about:**
```
I help dental practices recover revenue from missed patient calls. It's a quick 30-second question for the doctor - is now a good time or should I call back?
```

### When You Get the Decision Maker (30 seconds)

```
Hi Dr. [Name], this is [Your Name] with DentalCall AI.

I'll be brief - I know you're busy.

Quick question: Do you know roughly how many patient calls your front desk misses each week?

[PAUSE - let them answer]
```

**If they say "I don't know":**
```
That's actually really common. Most practices we work with had no idea either.

When we looked at the data across 50 practices, the average was 32% of calls going unanswered - usually when staff are with patients or during lunch.

At $850 per new patient, that's potentially $100K+ per year in lost revenue.

We built an AI that answers those calls 24/7, sounds completely human, and books appointments automatically.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute demo to see if it makes sense for your practice?
```

**If they say a number (e.g., "Maybe 10-15"):**
```
Got it. At $850 average patient value, that's potentially $10-15K per month walking out the door.

We've helped practices like [similar practice name] recover that revenue with an AI that answers calls 24/7.

Would 15 minutes this week work to show you how it works?
```

### Handling Objections

**"We don't have a problem with missed calls"**
```
That's great! Most practices don't realize they have one until they track it.

Quick question - do you have anyone answering calls after 6pm or on weekends?

[If no] That's actually when 30% of patient calls come in. Those are going straight to voicemail right now.

Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if we could capture some of those?
```

**"We already use an answering service"**
```
Totally understand. A lot of practices do.

The challenge is most answering services just take messages - they don't book appointments.

Our AI actually has a conversation, checks your calendar, and books the appointment right there. Plus it costs about 50% less.

Worth a quick comparison call?
```

**"We're not interested"**
```
Totally fair. Before I let you go - out of curiosity, what's your biggest challenge with patient communication right now?

[Listen - might uncover a different pain point]

Appreciate your time either way. If things change, we're at DentalCall AI dot com.
```

**"Send me information"**
```
Happy to. What's the best email?

[Get email]

Great, I'll send that over. What I'll include is a case study from a practice your size that recovered $47K in lost revenue.

When would be a good time to follow up - Thursday or Friday?
```

**"How much does it cost?"**
```
Plans start at $299/month for smaller practices, up to $999 for multi-location.

But honestly, the ROI is what matters. If you're missing even 10 calls a month, that's $8,500 in lost revenue. The AI pays for itself in the first week.

We also do a 7-day free trial so you can see it working before any commitment.

Would Thursday work for a quick demo?
```

### Closing

```
Great, let me grab your email to send a calendar invite.

[Get email]

Perfect. You'll get an invite for [day/time]. I'll show you exactly how it works in about 15 minutes, and if it's not a fit, no pressure at all.

Thanks Dr. [Name], talk soon!
```
