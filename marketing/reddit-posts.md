## Post 1: r/dentistry - Value First

**Title:** We tracked missed calls at 50 dental practices. The data is shocking.

**Body:**
Hey r/dentistry,

My team spent 3 months tracking phone data across 50 dental practices (with their permission). Here's what we found:

**The Numbers:**
- Average practice misses 32% of incoming calls
- 85% of patients who hit voicemail never call back
- Each missed call = $850+ in lost lifetime patient value
- Busiest miss times: 11am-1pm and 4-6pm (when staff are with patients)

**Why It Happens:**
1. Front desk juggling check-ins, checkouts, and phones
2. Lunch breaks with no coverage
3. After-hours calls going straight to VM
4. Hold times causing hangups

**What Top Practices Do Differently:**
- Dedicated phone staff (expensive)
- Overflow to answering service (often poor quality)
- AI phone systems (what we ended up building)

We actually built a solution for this - an AI that answers dental calls 24/7, sounds completely natural, and books appointments directly. Happy to share more if anyone's interested.

But even without our tool - just tracking your missed call rate would be eye-opening. Most practice owners have no idea how many calls they're losing.

Anyone else tracking this? What's your experience?

## Post 2: r/smallbusiness - Problem/Solution

**Title:** How I helped a dental practice recover $47K in lost revenue (and how any service business can do the same)

**Body:**
Last year, a dentist friend complained about slow growth despite good marketing. I offered to look at his numbers.

**What I Found:**
- His website got 400+ visits/month
- Google Ads were generating 80+ calls/month
- But only 55 were being answered
- 25 calls = voicemail = lost patients

He was spending $3K/month on marketing, then losing 30% of leads to missed calls.

**The Math:**
- 25 missed calls × $850 avg patient value = $21,250/month lost
- That's $255K/year walking out the door

**The Fix:**
We set up an AI phone system that:
- Answers every call in <1 second
- Sounds completely human
- Books appointments 24/7
- Texts confirmations automatically

**Results After 90 Days:**
- Call answer rate: 67% → 93%
- New patients/month: 12 → 19
- Monthly revenue increase: ~$47K annually

The crazy part? The AI costs less than one part-time receptionist.

This works for any appointment-based business: medical, legal, home services, etc.

Happy to share more details if anyone's dealing with similar issues.

## Post 3: r/Entrepreneur - Launch Story

**Title:** Just launched an AI that answers phone calls for businesses. Here's what I learned building it.

**Body:**
Hey r/Entrepreneur,

6 months ago I started building an AI receptionist after watching my dentist lose patients to voicemail.

**The Problem:**
Small businesses miss 30%+ of calls. Each missed call = lost revenue. Most can't afford 24/7 staff.

**The Solution:**
AI that answers calls naturally, handles questions, and books appointments. Works 24/7, costs <$20/day.

**What I Learned Building It:**

1. **Pick a niche first** - Started broad, failed. Niched to dental, grew 10x faster.

2. **Pricing courage matters** - Started at $99/mo, no one took it seriously. Raised to $299-999, conversions went UP.

3. **Cold email still works** - Sent 200 personalized emails yesterday, already have 3 demo requests.

4. **The "AI sounds robotic" objection is dead** - Modern voice AI is indistinguishable from humans.

5. **B2B SaaS is a grind** - Every customer requires hand-holding initially. But retention is incredible.

**Current Stats:**
- Launched 48 hours ago
- 197 cold emails sent
- 3 demo requests
- $0 revenue (free trials)
- Target: $500K MRR in 12 months

If anyone's building in the voice AI space or targeting healthcare, happy to share what's working.

## Post 4: r/startups - Seeking Feedback

**Title:** Roast my landing page - AI receptionist for dental practices

**Body:**
Hey r/startups,

Just launched and looking for brutal feedback on our landing page.

**What we do:** AI that answers phone calls for dental practices 24/7, books appointments, handles patient questions.

**Target market:** Dental practices losing patients to missed calls (which is basically all of them - avg practice misses 32%).

**Pricing:** $299-999/mo with 7-day free trial

**Link:** [local-lift.onrender.com]

**Specific questions:**
1. Is the value prop clear within 5 seconds?
2. Does the pricing feel right?
3. What's missing that would make you convert?
4. Any red flags that would make you bounce?

Will respond to every piece of feedback. Thanks in advance!

## Post 5: r/SaaS - Metrics Post

**Title:** Day 2 of launching my SaaS - sharing real numbers

**Body:**
Building in public. Here's day 2 of DentalCall AI (AI receptionist for dental practices):

**Yesterday:**
- Sent 197 cold emails
- 3 demo requests (1.5% response rate)
- 0 trials started
- 0 revenue

**Today's Plan:**
- Follow up sequence starts
- LinkedIn outreach (50 connections)
- Reddit distribution (you're reading it)
- Google Ads launch ($100/day)

**The Product:**
- AI answers dental office calls 24/7
- Books appointments naturally
- Handles patient questions
- $299-999/mo

**Why I Think This Works:**
- Clear ROI: avg practice loses $100K+/year to missed calls
- AI is good enough now (patients can't tell)
- Dental is massive TAM ($150B market)
- Recurring revenue, low churn (once setup, they never leave)

**Target:** $500K MRR in 12 months

Will post weekly updates. Roast me or AMA!
