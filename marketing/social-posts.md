## REDDIT - r/medspa

**Title:** Built an AI that recovers no-shows automatically - looking for beta testers

**Body:**
```
Hey med spa owners,

I built an AI that texts patients within an hour of a missed appointment. Getting about 70% of them to rebook within 48 hours.

It also answers calls 24/7 and responds to leads in under 5 minutes.

Looking for 5 med spas to try it free for 14 days. I'll help you set it up personally.

You can hear how it sounds by calling the demo: (833) 425-1223

Anyone interested?

**Title:** Service business owners - how do you handle after-hours inquiries?

**Body:**
```
Running a service business (appointments-based). Getting a lot of inquiries after we close - website forms, missed calls, etc.

By the time we respond in the morning, a lot of them have already booked with competitors.

What are you all doing about this? Hiring night staff? Using some kind of answering service? I've been testing an AI solution that answers calls 24/7 but curious what others do.

## REDDIT - r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Just launched: AI phone answering for service businesses

**Body:**
```
Built this over the past few months. It's an AI that:
- Answers calls 24/7
- Books appointments automatically
- Texts no-shows to get them rescheduled
- Responds to new leads in under 5 minutes

Targeting med spas initially because they lose so much to no-shows (~20% industry average).

Free trial if anyone wants to test: (833) 425-1223

Feedback welcome - still iterating.

## LINKEDIN POST

```
Med spa owners: you're probably losing $8K/month and don't realize it.

Here's the math:
• 20% no-show rate (industry average)
• 80 appointments/week
• $350 average treatment
= 64 missed appointments/month
= $22,400 in lost potential revenue

Even if only 35% would have been recoverable, that's ~$8K.

The solution isn't calling them hours later when you notice.

It's texting them within 60 minutes with an easy rebook option.

I built an AI that does exactly this.

If you want to hear how it sounds, call (833) 425-1223

Quick question for the group:

How many no-shows did you have last week?

I was losing $6-8K/month to missed appointments until I automated the follow-up. Now recovering about 70% of them within 48 hours.

Happy to share what I set up if anyone's interested. It's not complicated but it made a huge difference.

Built an AI that recovers no-shows for med spas.

Here's why it works 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Problem: 20% of med spa appointments are no-shows.

At $350/treatment, that's $8K+/month in lost revenue.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Traditional solution: Call them when you notice (usually hours later).

By then they've forgotten, made other plans, or feel awkward.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Better solution: AI texts within 1 hour of the missed appointment.

"Hi [Name], we missed you today! Want to reschedule? Reply with a time that works."

70% rebook within 48 hours.
```

Hey [Name],

Quick question - what's your no-show rate like at [Spa Name]?

I built something that's helping med spas recover 70% of missed appointments automatically. Takes about 10 min to set up.

Not trying to sell you anything - just looking for feedback from actual spa owners.

Would you have 5 min for a quick call this week?
