Dental practices are losing $100K+/year to missed calls. Here's the math:

32% of calls go unanswered (staff busy with patients)
85% of those callers don't leave voicemails
Average new patient = $850/year value

Miss 10 calls/month = $100K+ lost annually.

Solution? AI that answers every call 24/7 → local-lift.onrender.com

### Title: How we helped dental practices recover $40K+ in lost revenue from missed calls
---
Hey everyone, wanted to share something we've been working on.

We analyzed call data from dental practices and found that on average, 32% of incoming calls go unanswered during business hours. Staff are with patients, at lunch, or juggling multiple things.

The problem? 85% of those callers don't leave voicemails. They just call the next dentist on their list.

We built an AI phone system specifically for dental practices. It:
- Answers every call in under 1 second
- Books appointments automatically
- Handles after-hours calls
- Sends SMS confirmations
- Provides call transcripts and recordings

We're offering a free 7-day trial for any practice that wants to try it.

Happy to answer any questions about how it works.
