## STEP 2: POST TO REDDIT (2 minutes)

### Post A: r/medspa (3.2K members)

**Go to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/medspa/submit

**Title:** Built an AI that recovers no-shows automatically - looking for beta testers

**Body:**
```
Hey med spa owners,

I built an AI receptionist that texts patients within an hour of a missed appointment. Getting about 70% of them to rebook.

It also answers calls 24/7 and responds to leads in under 5 minutes (I was terrible at this and losing patients to faster competitors).

Looking for 5 med spas to try it free for 30 days. I'll help you set it up.

If you want to hear how it sounds first, you can call the demo line: (833) 425-1223 - ask it about Botox pricing or say you missed an appointment.

Anyone interested? DM me or comment below.
```

### Post B: r/smallbusiness (1.2M members)

**Go to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/submit

**Title:** Service business owners: How do you handle after-hours inquiries?

**Body:**
```
Running a service business (appointments-based). Getting a lot of inquiries after we close - website forms, missed calls, etc.

By the time we respond in the morning, a lot of them have already booked with competitors.

What are you all doing about this? Hiring night staff? Using some kind of answering service?

I've been testing an AI solution but curious what others do.
```

## STEP 3: POST TO LINKEDIN (2 minutes)

**Go to:** https://www.linkedin.com/feed/ and click "Start a post"

**Post:**
```
Med spa owners: you're probably losing $8K/month and don't realize it.

Here's the math:
• 20% no-show rate (industry average)
• 80 appointments/week
• $350 average treatment

= 64 missed appointments/month
= $22,400 in lost potential revenue

Even if only 35% would have been recoverable, that's ~$8K.

The solution isn't calling them hours later when you notice.

It's texting them within 60 minutes with an easy rebook option.

I built an AI that does exactly this. 70% rebook within 48 hours.

If you want to hear how it sounds, call (833) 425-1223 and ask about Botox pricing or say you missed your appointment.

## STEP 4: JOIN FACEBOOK GROUPS & POST (5 minutes)

Join these groups:
- Medical Spa Business Owners
- Aesthetic Injectors Network
- Med Spa Marketing & Growth

**Post in each:**
```
Quick question for the group:

How many no-shows did you have last week?

I was losing $6-8K/month to missed appointments until I automated the follow-up. Now getting about 70% of them rescheduled within 48 hours.

Happy to share what I did if anyone's interested. It's not complicated but it made a huge difference for my numbers.
```

---

## STEP 5: SEND 5 LINKEDIN DMs (5 minutes)

Search LinkedIn for "med spa owner" or "aesthetic practice owner"

**Message Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question - what's your no-show rate like at [Spa Name]?

I built something that's helping med spas recover 70% of missed appointments automatically. Takes about 10 min to set up.

Not trying to sell you anything - just looking for feedback from actual spa owners.

Would you have 5 min for a quick call this week?
```

---

## TOTAL TIME: ~15 minutes

That's it. 15 minutes of posting, then wait for the leads to come in.

The monitoring script will SMS you when someone signs up.
