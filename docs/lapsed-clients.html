        <div class="stat-box">
            <div class="number">70%</div>
            <p>of lapsed clients would return if you simply reached out</p>
        </div>

        <p>Look at your client database. How many people came in once or twice... and then disappeared? For most med spas, it's 40-60% of their total client list.</p>

        <p>These aren't lost causes. They're your warmest leads. They already trust you. They already have payment info on file. They just need a reason to come back.</p>

        <h2>Why Clients Lapse</h2>

        <p>Understanding why helps you craft the right message:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Life got busy (45%):</strong> They meant to rebook but it slipped their mind</li>
            <li><strong>Forgot about you (25%):</strong> Out of sight, out of mind</li>
            <li><strong>Waiting for a reason (15%):</strong> Need a special offer or new treatment to motivate them</li>
            <li><strong>Financial timing (10%):</strong> Needed to wait for the right time</li>
            <li><strong>Actually churned (5%):</strong> Moved, changed preferences, or had a bad experience</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notice: <strong>95% of lapsed clients didn't leave because they were unhappy.</strong> They just need a nudge.</p>

        <h2>The Cost of Not Reaching Out</h2>

        <p>Let's do the math:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lapsed clients (90+ days since last visit): 200</li>
            <li>Potential reactivation rate: 15%</li>
            <li>Reactivated clients: 30</li>
            <li>Average treatment value: $400</li>
            <li><strong>Recovered revenue: $12,000</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's $12,000 you're leaving on the table every month by not reaching out.</p>

        <h2>The Reactivation Sequence That Works</h2>

        <h3>Day 90: The "We Miss You" Text</h3>
        <div class="template">
            "Hi [Name]! It's been a while since we've seen you at [Med Spa]. We miss you! Reply YES and I'll find a time that works for your next treatment."
        </div>

        <h3>Day 97: The Value Reminder</h3>
        <div class="template">
            "Hey [Name], just a friendly reminder that regular [treatment] maintenance helps you get the best results. We've got some openings this week if you'd like to come in!"
        </div>

        <h3>Day 104: The Incentive Offer</h3>
        <div class="template">
            "[Name], we'd love to welcome you back! Here's 15% off your next treatment. Book before [date] to claim it. Reply or call us at [number]."
        </div>

        <h3>Day 120: The New Treatment Alert</h3>
        <div class="template">
            "Hi [Name]! We just added [new treatment] to our menu—it's perfect for [benefit]. Thought of you! Want to be one of the first to try it?"
        </div>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Personalization dramatically increases response rates. Use their name, reference their past treatment, and mention specific time since last visit.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Manual Reactivation Fails</h2>

        <p>You know you should reach out to lapsed clients. So why doesn't it happen?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your front desk is too busy with current clients</li>
            <li>No one owns the responsibility</li>
            <li>It's tedious to personalize messages at scale</li>
            <li>You don't have a system to track who's lapsed</li>
            <li>By the time you remember, they've been gone 6+ months</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How AI Automates Reactivation</h2>

        <p>With AI-powered reactivation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic detection:</strong> System flags clients at 90, 120, 180 days</li>
            <li><strong>Personalized outreach:</strong> AI crafts messages using their name and treatment history</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-channel:</strong> SMS, email, and voice calls</li>
            <li><strong>Smart timing:</strong> Sends when they're most likely to respond</li>
            <li><strong>Easy rebooking:</strong> One-click scheduling links</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example AI Reactivation Flow</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Day 90: Automated "we miss you" SMS</li>
            <li>Day 93: Follow-up if no response</li>
            <li>Day 100: AI voice call with personalized message</li>
            <li>Day 107: Email with special offer</li>
            <li>Day 120: Final SMS with urgency</li>
        </ol>

        <p>All automated. Zero manual work. Clients reactivated on autopilot.</p>

        <h2>Real Results</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Glow Aesthetics:</strong> Reactivated 47 clients in first month, $18,800 recovered revenue</li>
            <li><strong>Pure Med Spa:</strong> 22% of lapsed clients rebooked within 30 days of campaign</li>
            <li><strong>Radiant Skin:</strong> Reduced client churn rate from 45% to 28%</li>
        </ul>
